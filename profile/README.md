## About Monas
Monas is developing a decentralized personal data store. We are following the Semantic web philosophy and building the missing components. Its component is the human space. The concept of Linked Data is utilized to realize the Semantic Web. This involves the idea of connecting multiple data points with solid lines to enable interoperability across different contexts, machines, and platforms.  
Monas addresses a missing component by enabling the connection of data with dotted lines, rather than solid lines. This approach allows users to decide whether to connect with solid or dotted lines, giving them the choice of where to connect. Consequently, this empowers users with control over their privacy.
